# Paroxytone

This project is a complete rewrite of [Oxytone](https://github.com/Vincent-Carrier/oxytone), based on BaseX and XQuery, instead of Python. The frontend has been rewritten with SvelteKit, instead of using makeshift Web Components.

To get started, you will need Git LFS, Just and BaseX installed.

```sh
just db
```
